Being a member of the ICM Lab does not require physical attendance or a local presence, and we invite members from the surrounding academic, Native American, activist, and professional communities to join us in our mission to generate partnerships, share resources and space, and unite to meet common research needs.

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement
The Indigenous Critical Media Lab at the University of Kansas aims to foster a community in which diversity is integral and people from different backgrounds are acknowledged and respected. Rooted in Indigenous methods and designed to first serve the needs of Indigenous students and community members, the ICMLab nevertheless welcomes current students, faculty members and staff from different backgrounds and with diverse perspectives. We encourage the free and respectful exchange of ideas that contribute to an understanding of media in the context of Indigenous cultural history and contemporary politics. We also welcome prospective students and staff members across KU and Haskell Indian Nations University, as well as other institutions and organizations to join us in our initiative.

We are committed to creating an inclusive environment in as many aspects as possible, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, socio-economic status, class, and religion.

### Statement of Recognition
We acknowledge that the land on which we gather is the traditional territory of the Kaw and Osage nations. As a regional initiative we recognize and actively support the sovereignty of all Indigenous nations in what is now the state of Kansas and across the Central Plains.
